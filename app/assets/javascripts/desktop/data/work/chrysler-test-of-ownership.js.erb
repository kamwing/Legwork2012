				"Minivans are the most researched vehicles on the road. But a lot of the information out there is written by people who only do a cursory evaluation of the cars they review. We had a much larger story to tell with real minivan owners and the data that represents their actions. We knew moms and dads would happily dive into all of the details, we just had to create a place that made it incredibly easy for them to do so."
