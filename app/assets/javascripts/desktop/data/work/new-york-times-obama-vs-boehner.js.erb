				"The New York Times approached us to create a video that accompanied an article explaining the failed 2011 debt deal between President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner. We partnered with writers at The New York Times to create a piece that  acts as a high-level recount of how the deal came to be â€” and how it ultimately unraveled."
