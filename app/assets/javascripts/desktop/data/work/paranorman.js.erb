The only thing was, it included a lot of ideas we weren't sure would be possible in the browsers we had to support. So, we focused a lot of our time up front to ensure we were all on the same page and prototyped the interactions we weren't sure about to understand their limitations before we started on the visual design. From their we prioritized features, created, revised and create more until we reached our deadline.</p><p><a href='http://test.legworkstudio.com/paranorman/desktop/' target='_new'>View Desktop Prototypes</a></p><p><a href='http://test.legworkstudio.com/paranorman/mobile/' target='_new'>View Mobile Prototypes</a></p>"

Sometimes this was pretty simple, like cutting out a character to separate them from a background, and other times it got pretty intense, like creating a photorealistic shower curtain out of nothing.<br><br>The following slides show a few examples of the image production we undertook."
