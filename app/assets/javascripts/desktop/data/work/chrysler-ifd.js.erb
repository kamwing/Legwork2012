				"We collaborated with Wieden+Kennedy in Portland to create a new site for Chrysler's Imported From Detroit brand. It serves as a hub for all of the campaign-related digital properties. The site features subtle interface tricks, a responsive design and compelling content to make a simple, but interesting experience for its users regardless of whether they view the site from their desktop, tablet or phone."
