				"For the second annual “24 Hours of Climate Reality” event on November 24, 2012, experts and celebrities conducted Dirty Weather Reports from across the globe. During the event, viewers were asked to join the global movement and demand action from their governments, and we were brought in to create an anthemic and informational video as their call-to-action. The piece we created uses a combination of smooth motion and textural cel animation to contrast and visualize the battle between good and evil."

The sound bed and voice talent helped establish an anthemic feel, but the way that we represented the users and the fossil fuel lobby had to feel human--that was very important to the overall composition of the piece.</p>"
