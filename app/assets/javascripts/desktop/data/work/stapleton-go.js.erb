				"Abodigy tasked us with creating a character-driven story to help make their unique service seem approachable and necessary. We developed a comprehensive illustration package including characters, various home styles, secondary objects and environments. The animation was created through a combination of 2D and subtle 3D elements, keeping the design focused and simple."
