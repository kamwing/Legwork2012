				"This Shell is an interactive music video to promote the Gamits 2010 record, Parts. We literally break the video we made into &quot;parts,&quot; and if a user can put it back together before the song ends they receive a free download of the song. This was a pure labor of love for us and an opportunity to experiment with new technologies. Check it out in Chrome or Firefox."
