			"overview": [
				"This Shell is an interactive music video to promote the Gamits 2010 record, Parts. We broke the video we made into &ldquo;parts&rdquo; and if a user can put it back together before the song ends they receive a free download of the song. This was a pure labour of love for us and an opportunity to experiment with new technologies."
