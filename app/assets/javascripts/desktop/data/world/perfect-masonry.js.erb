				"Currently there are a few plugins out there that allow you to arrange items into a nice grid â€“ like Masonry and its smarter brother Isotope. The issue with these plugins, however, is that sometimes there are gaps in your grid. So, one of our developers, Drew Dahlman, created a jQuery plugin that enables a perfect grid of randomly sized elements with no gaps and a bunch of other features."
