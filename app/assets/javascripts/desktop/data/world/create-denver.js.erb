				"Create Denver is a week long celebration of the collective creative industries here in town. Its a great outlet for people to really push themselves, as there isn't the typical client relationship and you can essentially do whatever you want. We have participated for a few years now, but one that really stands out was 2011, when we were asked to create and execute a projection mapping of the Ellie Caukins Opera House for the closing party.
